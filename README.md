# Twinkl Phonics Atomic Architecture
## Creator - Pearl Vernon-Howe
A place to experiment with a new atomic design structure for the Twinkl Phonics Application
All the directories in this repository will be within the src directory of the main Phonics project.

### How to use this repository
This repository is built to be used as a reference for the new atomic architecture. The directory structure should eventually match the main twinkl-phonics repo. Each directory has an .md file to describe the contents that should be in the directory

### Legacy directories that still need to be processed
styles: decide where general styling will live and how it will be written (emotion, css, sass)
hooks: create separate directories and ts files for each existing hook
